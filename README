                            1.) Setup
________________________________________________________________________________

Speclab does *not* work out of the box. You have to run one function beforehand,
aptly named 'setup.m'. This file is located in the base directory of the Speclab
bundle. You can just cd into the directory in Matlab, and run

>> setup;

Depending on what your directory structure is set up like, setup might make some
comments about ignoring directories. Setup should terminate with some
nice-sounding message(s) about successfully doing things. 

Speclab is now set up and ready for use. In the course of your computations, if
you ever run 'clear all' or 'clear global' then *you will have to run setup
again*.  

PLEASE READ THE EXAMPLES SECTION IN THIS FILE BEFORE PROCEEDING TO USE SPECLAB.

Optional reading:

setup.m does two things:
1.) Creates a Matlab-global variable called 'handles'. handles is a nested
    struct whose tree-like structure mimics Speclab's directory structure. Each
    node of the tree corresponds to an m-file function inside Speclab. In this
    way, functions in e.g. the Fourier side of Speclab can access functions in
    the Jacobi polynomial section of Speclab without needing to do messy things
    like changing directories or adding a bunch of directories to Matlab's PATH
    variable, thereby polluting the command line namespace. As mentioned before,
    if you happen to clear this global variable, you'll have to run setup.m
    again to rewrite it. You can inspect handles yourself by typing

    >> global handles

    at the command line. And then inspecting the variable.

2.) Regrettably...adds some directories to Matlab's PATH variable. However, the
    only directories it adds are those associated with class declarations.
    Function names are not introduced into the global path at all, only class
    names.  

    Class names are declared in the FirstLetterUppercase format. Functions are
    declared in the all_lowercase_underscore_separation format. This rubric is
    (hopefully) consistent across Speclab. 

________________________________________________________________________________

                            2.) Validation Tests
________________________________________________________________________________

Once setup.m is run, Speclab is ready to go. However, for peace of mind, it
might be beneficial to run the Speclab validation tests. Running these tests can
take up to 5 minutes, but generally only take 2 minutes or so. 

>> setup;
>> global handles
>> handles.debug.all_tests();

This runs a bunch (~400) of tests with some relatively well-formatted output.
The test parameters are randomized, so it's not a big deal if a dozen or so of
the tests fail. I haven't gotten around to tweaking the randomness to ensure
success. 

NOTE: As of this writing, Speclab does *not* require class/object-oriented
support in Matlab to work. (That will change in the future.) However, running
the validation tests *does* require classes. The validation tests should run
with Matlab version >= 7.6 (R2008a). For lower versions, Matlab will probably
return a slew of errors.

                            3.) Examples
________________________________________________________________________________

All examples are contained in the speclab/examples folder. All examples are
script m-files with code and comments to describe what is going on.  You should
be able to jump to whatever expansion you care about and start running those
examples. However, it is *highly recommended* that you go through the Chebyshev
examples first (speclab/examples/jacobi/chebyshev). The Chebyshev example files
contain comments that describe the gist of how to run things in Speclab
including helpstring format, parameter inputs, general structure of a spectral
expansion. 

The other expansion examples do not go into such wordy detail in the comments
and assume you know how to do basic things in Speclab.

                            4.) Other README's
________________________________________________________________________________

Each spectral expansion type in Speclab has it's own README with basis-specific
information about what is and is not available, and also TODO lists. The other
README files are

-- speclab/orthopoly1d/README
-- speclab/orthopoly1d/jacobi/README
-- speclab/orthopoly1d/fourier/README
-- speclab/orthopoly1d/wiener/README

TODO: hermite, sinc, laguerre, other mapped methods
