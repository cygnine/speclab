The Legendre approximation is a special case of the Jacobi approximation. You
must specify alpha=beta=0 in calling the Jacobi routines, or the routines will
default to Chebyshev instead.

If you've seen the Chebyshev examples, you can jump right in anywhere.

Legendre examples
- resolution_scaling: the function speclab/orthopoly1d/jacobi/affine_scaling.m
  calculates affine shift+scale parameters based on a desired interval of
  approximation. It can also put some percentage of the `resolution' for a given
  expansion of order N inside a desired interval. For example, you can put 65%
  of the 'resolution' of an N-function Legendre expansion inside the interval
  [-5,0]. The function will return the desired shift+scale parameters to do
  this. The measure of resolution is based on canonical quadrature points of the
  expansion.
- approximation_convergence: Legendre expansions converge quickly if the
  function is analytic. This file shows an example of this via plots. 

What's coded (easily accessible):
- evaluation of monic/L2-normalized polynomials + any order derivative
- Gauss-(Radau/Lobatto)-type quadratures
- O(N) application of the stiffness matrix operator
- scale/shift parameters for explicit affine scaling
- affine mapping determination based on given interval of approximation
- affine mapping determination based on fractional resolution inside a specified
  interval

What's coded (not-so-easily accessible):
- connection coefficients between Chebyshev and other Jacobi classes with
  alpha and beta integers
- nodal/modal differentiation matrices (of any order)
