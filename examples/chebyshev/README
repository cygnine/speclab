The Chebyshev approximation is a special case of the Jacobi approximation. This
is the default for the Jacobi approximation. 

The Chebyshev examples go over the basics of how to use Speclab. It's
recommended that you go through these examples in the following order:
- intro.m
- scaling.m
- chebfft.m

What's coded (easily accessible):
- evaluation of monic/L2-normalized polynomials + any order derivative
- Gauss-(Radau/Lobatto)-type quadratures
- FFT for nodal/modal transformations (so far on interior Gauss points only)
- O(N) application of the stiffness matrix operator
- scale/shift parameters for explicit affine scaling
- affine mapping determination based on given interval of approximation
- affine mapping determination based on fractional resolution inside a specified
  interval

What's coded (not-so-easily accessible):
- connection coefficients between Chebyshev and other Jacobi classes with
  2*alpha and 2*beta odd integers
- nodal/modal differentiation matrices (of any order)
