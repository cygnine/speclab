This folder contains examples for Jacobi polynomial approximations. Legendre and
Chebyshev are technically special cases of Jacobi, but they have separate
folders to illustrate more basic coding concepts. This folder contains some
advanced examples.

Jacobi examples
- jacobi_fft: The FFT may be used to calculated Jacobi polynomial expansion
  modal coefficients from evaluations at the Chebyshev nodes if both 2*alpha and
  2*beta are odd integers in O(N log N) time.
- gibbs_resolution: Gottlieb and Shu proposed a post-processing method for
  pointwise recovery of function values free of any Gibbs' phenomenon that
  might be present. The method is a filtering method based on expansion in
  Gegenbauer polynomials.

What's coded (easily accessible):
- evaluation of monic/L2-normalized polynomials + any order derivative
- Gauss-(Radau/Lobatto)-type quadratures
- FFT if 2*alpha and 2*beta are odd integers
- O(N) application of the stiffness matrix operator
- Connections between Jacobi polynomial classes where alpha and beta are
  separated by integers. 
- scale/shift parameters for explicit affine scaling
- affine mapping determination based on given interval of approximation
- affine mapping determination based on fractional resolution inside a specified
  interval

What's coded (not-so-easily accessible):
- nodal/modal differentiation matrices (of any order)
