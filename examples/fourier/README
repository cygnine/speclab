This folder contains examples for generalized Fourier Series approximations. A
(generalized) Fourier Series family is defined by two parameters: (gamma,
delta). (Cf. Jacobi polynomial expansion parameters) Both gamma and delta must
be greater than -1/2, and gamma=delta=0 corresponds to the classical Fourier
Series.

Fourier examples
- intro: Basic operations for Fourier expansions. The code has a slightly different
  flavor than e.g. Chebyshev expansions.
- fft_example: usage of the FFT routines, online/offline method.

What's coded (easily accessible):
- evaluation of L2-normalized Fourier Series and their first derivatives
- Gauss-type quadratures and "pi"-Gauss-type quadratures. See
  speclab/fourier/quad/pi_gauss_quadrature.m
- FFT if gamma and delta are integers
- Connections between Fourier Series expansions when the difference between the
  parameter values for gamma and delta are both integers.
- scale/shift parameters for explicit affine scaling
- affine mapping determination based on given interval of approximation
- affine mapping determination based on fractional resolution inside a specified
  interval

What's coded (not-so-easily accessible):
- nodal/modal differentiation matrices (of order 1)
