This folder contains examples for generalized Wiener rational function
approximations. These functions are a mapping and weighting of the generalized
Fourier series to the real line. They are parameterized by s>1/2. s=1 is the
original Wiener basis and corresponds to the classical Fourier series. 

Wiener examples
- plot_functions: Basic operations and plotting of some of the Wiener rational
  functions. 
- wfft_examples: Illustration of usage of the Wiener FFT collocation and Galerkin
  algorithms.
- stiff_matrix: Generation of some example stiffness matrices. Numerical
  demonstrations that the stiffness matrices are indeed sparse; verification of
  their spectral radius.

What's coded (easily accessible):
- evaluation of L2-normalized Wiener functions and their first derivatives
- Gauss-type quadratures and "pi"-Gauss-type quadratures. See
  speclab/wiener/quad/pi_gauss_quadrature.m
- FFT `collocation' and `Galerkin' methods if s is an integer
- Sparse stiffness matrix generation
- scale/shift parameters for explicit affine scaling
- affine mapping determination based on given interval of approximation
- affine mapping determination based on fractional resolution inside a specified
  interval

What's coded (not-so-easily accessible):
- nodal/modal differentiation matrices (of order 1)
- Connections between Wiener expansions when the difference between the
  parameter value for s is an integer.
